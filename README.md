## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

- In my understanding, Service Oriented Architecture is a software development that is focused on reusable services. And these reusable services are used to make new applications and by using SOA or Service Oriented Architecture, the services can communicate or work well together across different platforms. For example, a developer is planning to create an application that will be use to cater users that orders food, or a food delivery service perhaps, like foodpanda. instead of creating its own login service, map service, or payment, the developer can reuse the API of google map service, implement the payment service of Paypal, and log in their account from facebook or gmail.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

- There are many characteristics of SOA according to our handout, and we will start with Standardized Service Contract. This is to ensure to achieve reusability potential of services. Next is Loose Coupling, which avoids crash if ever there are parts of services that break. This makes the services independent from each other. Third is Abstraction, this talks about encapsulation, keeping users or the outside world from seeing the logic. Fourth is Service Reusability, which is of course its intent to maximize reusability by dividing the logics in applications into services. Next, Autonomy, from the word autonomy, meaning freedom or independency, is about having control or ability to carry out the logic independently. Sixth is Statelessness, from what I understand, this is to promote and maximize scalability and also reusability by services minimizing its operations or information that they handle. Next is Service Discoverability, which is the storing of metadata or data in what they cal service registry or profile documents. Eighth is the Composability, it involves breaking large problems into tiny or smaller problems. Last is Service Interoperability, which enables the operation of various distributed web services across a range of hardware architectures and software platforms.

3. Define Microservices.

- Microservices in my own understanding, are loosely coupled and reusable components. For example, we have web, mobile and pc who are loosely coupled. Each of them has their own function, for example shopping cart, billing and user profile. These are microservices. Microservices architectures are composed of these many loosely coupled and independent smaller services.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

- First, Independently deployable. Since their services are smaller and independently deployable, there is a benefit in speed, which is they do not take huge amounts of time, the developer's team can understand easier the code and contribute it faster. Next, Right Tool for the job, instead of using the same stack, data model, or database, in microservices it is possible for every services stack to be optimized for that service. Also, another benefit is precise scaling. Since they enable precise scaling of only the components that need it, they enable less infrastructure than monolithic applications.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

- According to what I've read, SOA or Service- Oriented Architecture is enterprise-wide and as what is mentioned earlier, it is reusable. Meanwhile, microservices architecture has an application scope. The SOA architectural style evolved into microservices architecture. Each microservice is a considerably smaller software component that focuses on a specific task, whereas each SOA service is a whole business capability.
